# Hydration Reminder

Remind yourself to get hydrated every once in a while and record your progress.

### How To

Download the [the latest version](https://github.com/zmn-hamid/HydrationReminder/releases/) from the releases, then run and enjoy. You can click
"Drunk" when you drink 1 cup, and Peed (lol) when you wanna reduce your today's record by 1 cup.

Settings can be changed in the `settings.ini` file. This file will be automatically generated next to the
app file. If you changed it and the app didn't work anymore, just delete it and re-open the app to make a
new one.

your record will be saved in `water_log.xlsx` next to your app file.

You can also do the "drunk" and "peed" from the tray icon as well. You have to close the app from tray, otherwise it'll keep open.
